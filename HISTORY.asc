0.1.10
------
### Remove invalid `git subtree pull` options

0.1.9
-----
### Install upgrade scripts

Fixes a bug where upgrade scripts (namely, sql/*--*--*.sql) were not being installed.

0.1.8
-----
### Remove META.json processing from base.mk

Processing the META file from inside make was problematic with make
dependencies. Now, a meta.mk file is generated and included as part of base.mk.

### Fix bugs with test directory creation

0.1.7
-----
### Better handling of test directories

Missing test directories should now be created as necessary.

### Ensure git repository is clean when running setup.sh
### Fix bug for excluding .asc files
### Enforce bash since -o errtrace isn't valid sh

### Minor documentation tweaks

0.1.6
-----
### Remove tap stuff from deps.sql

Having the tap stuff in deps.sql was confusing because it was also loaded by
setup.sql. Just let setup.sql handle it, as that's what most people should
probably do. At some point we'll probably need a way to over-ride this
though...

### Improve warning about extra pgxntool-sync-* targets

0.1.5
-----

### Change $(DATA) to rely on $(EXTENSION_VERSION_FILES) instead of what's on the filesystem.

This is necessary because some install targets are generated and would not
necessarily be on the filesystem when we installed. This also prevents
installing leftover cruft from old versions.

### Improve formatting of print-% target
