= PGXNtool
Easier PGXN development

PGXNtool is meant to make developing new Postgres extensions for http://pgxn.org[PGXN] easier.

Currently, it consists a base Makefile that you can include instead of writing your own, a template META.json, and some test framework. More features will be added over time.

If you find any bugs or have ideas for improvements, please https://github.com/decibel/pgxntool/issues[*open an issue*].

== Install
This assumes that you've already initialized your extension in git.

NOTE: The `--squash` is important! Otherwise you'll clutter your repo with a bunch of commits you probably don't want.

----
git subtree add -P pgxntool --squash git@github.com:decibel/pgxntool.git release
pgxntool/setup.sh
----

TODO: Create a nice script that will init a new project for you.

== Usage
Typically, you can just create a simple Makefile that does nothing but include base.mk:

----
include pgxntool/base.mk
----

== make targets
These are the make targets that are provided by base.mk

NOTE: all the targets normally provided by Postgres http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/extend-pgxs.html[PGXS] still work.

=== test
Runs unit tests via the PGXS `installcheck` target. Unlike a simple `make installcheck` though, the `test` rule has the following prerequisites: clean testdeps install installcheck. All of those are PGXS rules, except for `testdeps`.

=== testdeps
This rule allows you to ensure certain actions have taken place before running tests. By default it has a single prerequisite, `pgtap`, which will attempt to install http://pgtap.org[pgtap] from PGXN. This depneds on having the pgxn client installed.

You can add any other dependencies you want by simply adding another `testdeps` rule. For example:

testdeps expmale from https://github.com/decibel/test_factory/blob/493020d29ba976c38a98e7f1c68bfd89900f0e22/Makefile#L4[test_factory]
----
testdeps: check_control

.PHONY: check_control
check_control:
	grep -q "requires = 'pgtap, test_factory'" test_factory_pgtap.control
----

If you want to over-ride the default dependency on `pgtap` you should be able to do that with a makefile override. If you need help with that, please https://github.com/decibel/pgxntool/issues[open an issue].

WARNING: It will probably cause problems if you try to create a `testdeps` rule that has a recipe. Instead of doing that, put the recipe in a separate rule and make that rule a prerequisite of `testdeps` as show in the example.

=== results
Because `make test` ultimately runs `installcheck`, it's using the Postgres test suite. Unfortunately, that suite is based on running `diff` between a raw output file and expected results. I *STRONGLY* recommend you use http://pgtap.org[pgTap] instead! The extra effort of learning pgTap will quickly pay for itself. https://github.com/decibel/trunklet-format/blob/master/test/sql/base.sql[This example] might help get you started.

No matter what method you use, once you know that all your tests are passing correctly, you need to create or update the test output expected files. `make results` does that for you.

=== tag
`make tag` will create a git branch for the current version of your extension, as determined by the META.json file. The reason to do this is so you can always refer to the exact code that went into a released version.

If there's already a tag for the current version that probably means you forgot to update META.json, so you'll get an error. If you're certain you want to over-write the tag, you can do `make forcetag`, which removes the existing tag (via `make rmtag`) and creates a new one.

WARNING: You will be very unhappy if you forget to update the .control file for your extension! There is an https://github.com/decibel/pgxntool/issues/1[open issue] to improve this.

=== dist
`make dist` will create a .zip file for your current version that you can upload to PGXN. The file is named after the PGXN name and version (the top-level "name" and "version" attributes in META.json). The .zip file is placed in the *parent* directory so as not to clutter up your git repo.

NOTE: Part of the `clean` recipe is cleaning up these .zip files. If you accidentally clean before uploading, just run `make dist-only`.

=== pgxntool-sync
This rule will pull down the latest released version of PGXNtool via `git subtree pull`.

NOTE: Your repository must be clean (no modified files) in order to run this. Running this command will produce a git commit of the merge.

TIP: There is also a `pgxntool-sync-%` rule if you need to do more advanced things.
